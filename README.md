# Minimizing health costs of procedure delay during COVID-19

## Overview
During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital systems postponed non-essential medical procedures to accomodate surge of critically-ill patients. We built a high-throughput pipeline that identifies procedures negatively impacted by COVID-19 and evaluates associations between procedure delay and patient outcomes. Our pipeline is implemented for EHRs using the OMOP Common Data Model.
